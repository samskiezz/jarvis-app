## Per-tick simulation pipeline (current)
1. Each Minion: decide (LLM/heuristic) → act → causal-belief update (#23)
2. Needs decay + wounds/infection (#32) + mood appraisal (#107)
3. Invention safety + peer review + replication (#71)
4. Projects pipeline
5. Ghost guidance (#139) · guild competition (#67) · education (#45)
6. Tech discovery (#22) · calendar advance (#16) · culture/religion (#46)
7. Memes (#142) · pollution (#36) · ecosystem/famine (#35)
8. Market snapshot every 10 ticks (#39/40)
9. Births / forks / deaths · population snapshot (knowledge, masters)

## Notable gaps to surface in the UI
Discoveries, economy/prices, worldview/culture, memes, environment (pollution +
wildlife), beliefs, ML models — all have endpoints but limited frontend panels.
